# My Assessment

Thank you for your time and consideration! This was a fun assessment to complete and show where I am today in my skills and knowledge.

You will find the following project structure: 

- `/assessment` directory housing my front-end code, using React to perform business logic and rendering.
- `/assessment-api` directory housing my back-end code, using Spring to serve my JSON data.

(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)

### Available Scripts for React Front End

In the project directory `/assessment`, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. If you view in browser, you will see a fake data seed, displayed with Material UI and showing order totals and calculated order rewards points.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
